            I had no idea about all the things I had to do to get married /
            things I needed to think about. Rachel explained everything to me
            and guided me through the whole process with enthusiasm and
            patience. She was wonderful to work with! I couldnâ€™t have been
            happier with her services and upbeat personality!
